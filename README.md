This program will create folders in your Pictures, Documents, and Downloads directories called 'Temp.' These folders can be used to store any files (like this installer) that you save or download to use once, but will not need again. Every time you log in, these folders will have been emptied, to keep those files from cluttering up your hard drive. In addition, every time you log in your Recycle Bin will have been emptied automatically. Files deleted this way will be recoverable from the Recycle Bin the first time you log in, and will be permanently deleted the second time.

It is recommended that you set these temp folders as your default download and screenshot locations, you can do this through your browser settings and your screenshot application settings respectively.

This version works for Windows 10 and Windows 7.
